                                   During the late 15th century, Elizabeth I was reigning on her throne and she had a great appreciation of the arts. She wanted her castle to be filled with glorious artworks that represented as masterpieces, like grand frescos and glorious statues and sculptures. People were very classy at the time, even their plates, utensils and sofas are decorated with accurate designs and images. The interiors and exteriors of the rich homes were also very meticulous and walls were embed with beautiful features such as fancy  patterns and adorned engravings. This marks the beginning of the elegant Elizabethan era, which is very important to humanity and history. While she was ruling over England, the paintings were mostly portraits. However, the details of these magnificent works of art was very intricate. Many of them were called miniatures because they were compact. One of the Queen’s favorite artists, Nicholas Hilliard, was creating these types of paintings. In fact, the large-scale artists during the time were influenced by his works. Nicholas was born in 1547 in Devon, England. When he was little, he studied French and he was learning about his Protestant religion. Later, he painted his first miniature portraits like Self Portrait Aged 13 and Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset. Hilliard wasn’t just a remarkable artist, he was goldsmith and jeweller. When Elizabeth I became queen, he designed a seal that represented her power and government. With his wife, he had one son named Laurence, who still passed on his style of miniature portraits. In 1619, he died in London, England. Not only small portraits were being painted, but immense, large-scale paintings brought the churches and Elizabeth’s palace into great expression. They were also influenced by Hilliard’s miniature works. Landscapes of England, mythical figures like the Centaur, and symbols like the skull were well found in these works. Artists such as Hans Holbein the Younger, Robert Peake the Elder and John de Critz play a significant role creating these antique Renaissance paintings. An example of these works is Hans Holbein's The Ambassadors. This painting portrays two noblemen, rich in wealth and pride, that are standing in front of a shelf with various astronomical and geological instruments. During the era, there were more scientific theories that were being proven because of these objects that were invented. Explorers were finding new land while the scientists examine the heavens and philosophers ponder on religion. If you can examine the painting closely to the side, you will see a hidden skull on the embroidered floor, which defines death. During the Elizabethan era, the artists use techniques to make their creations realistic and astonishing. These special effects are the following: perspective, foreshortening, anamorphosis and chiaroscuro. Perspective describes portraying images that look three-dimensional on the paper. Foreshortening hides mysterious illusions in the background that have symbolism. Anamorphosis portrays distorted images that blend into the background, just like the skull in The Ambassadors. Finally, chiaroscuro creates the contrast between dark and light in the painting. Architecture in the era showed great potential, history, beauty and culture. The people of the Renaissance in fact were influenced by the Romans and Greeks that were living hundred years ago before them. Columns at the front of the rich class houses is a good example of this. In 1514 to 1528, architects built the Hampton Court which was the first Renaissance style building during the era. It was designed by Cardinal Wolsey, who was a politician. Elegant statues around the houses were also found because of their majestic style. Craftsmen carved, sculpted and polished masterpieces that were decorated in exteriors and interiors of homes of the first-class citizens, including the queen herself.  Delicate and accurate carvings such as grotesque figures and angels were found on walls and furniture. Even the ceilings were decorated with fabulous engravings. The upper class citizens had remarkable homes but the poor citizens did not have the same style.

                                                               The upper class homes also had strong bricks and perfected the decorations and structure. They wanted to out stand the other social classes by the wealth and beauty. The details were very precise and the artworks were immaculate and are found everywhere you look. There are various rooms such as a game, study and rest rooms. The interiors also had magnificent wall carvings and long hallways. Outside of these classy houses, there is a grand garden that colourful flowers and healthy plants grow. Basically, their homes were not overprotective like the middle ages. There was no moat or surrounding wall to protect from any other enemies. Queen Elizabeth I wanted be pleasurable in her home which meant that she wanted open space and colour in her home, in order for it to be luxurious. She also didn’t want be offensive or protective like the middle ages. Freedom and space was very important in the era. However, there were still guards that protect the castle by watching for any other harmful trespassers. The middle class homes are similar to the Gothic homes that the nobles were living in. They were built with wood (timber and oak), bricks, plaster, clay and stones. The boards were placed diagonally and horizontally around the house. Certain homes have windows made of glass just like the rich. They made the house more extensive, so the nobles could live comfortably and breath better. The roofs of the houses were covered with compiled straw for the animals that the people kept on their roof. However, sometimes the rain washes away the animals when it becomes slippery. In general, these houses are more sturdy and protective than the lower class houses. They were less likely to be damaged from extreme weather conditions. Their interiors are decorated with miniature portraits of their close relatives. The walls and glass windows are extensive to bring out more space and to forget about previous wars in the medieval times. Like the upper class, the exteriors are painted with gold and silver to show that they are more superior in status. Finally, the poorest citizens had obviously the least illustrious homes. The houses are made of wood that are constructed diagonally and horizontally. Dirt and plants also hold the house in place. The people could not afford bricks for the house, since it was very expensive. The structure isn’t that complex as the middle class homes nor the upper class. The design is very cheap and the size of the cottages are very quaint. There were no carvings, statues or fancy paintings that are hung on the walls. It is very simple, but functional to cook, clean and manage the house.
